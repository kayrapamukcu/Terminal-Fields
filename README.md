# Terminal Fields

Terminal Fields is a 2D game developed using C++ and SFML. Mostly done as a fun project and to dip my toes in C++ :) It should run on Windows Vista and later, and Linux as well, although that's untested for now.

The game loop is currently not finished.

## Getting Started

You can find the latest release in the releases tab, but if you want to, you can compile the code yourself:

### Compiling with CMake

To compile Terminal Fields, you will need to have CMake and MinGW installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kayrapamukcu/TerminalFields.git
cd TerminalFields
```
2. **Create a build directory**
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```
3. **Build the project**
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
4. **Run it**

The executable should be in `build/bin` now.
